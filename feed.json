            "content_html": "<p>Melitas are very popular honey cookies from Argentina. I couldn't find anything similar in Canada, so I started making them myself. I started off with <a href=\"https://matiaschavero.com/2020/12/03/galletas-de-miel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matias Chavero's recipe</a> and after many batches and many small tweaks, I found the perfect balance to make them to my tasting. They are, dare I say, even better than the original cookies. I love dunking them on tea!</p>\n<p>This recipe yields about 20 cookies, and they can be frozen either before or after baking. They keep really well for about a week in an airtight container.</p>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>135 g <em>(⅔ cup + 1 tbsp)</em> neutral flavour vegetable oil (I use sunflower seed oil)</li>\n<li>175 g <em>(1 cup, packed)</em> brown sugar (either dark, light or a combination of both works)</li>\n<li>10 g (2 tsp) granulated sugar</li>\n<li>1 egg</li>\n<li>70 g <em>(¼ cup)</em> honey</li>\n<li>230 g <em>(1 ⅓ cup)</em> all-purpose flour</li>\n<li>5 g <em>(1 tsp)</em> baking soda</li>\n<li>2 g <em>(½ tsp)</em> salt</li>\n<li>5 g <em>(1 tsp)</em> vanilla extract</li>\n<li>About ¼ cup granulated sugar to decorate</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Preparation</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Preheat oven to 360ºF</li>\n<li>Line a couple baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats (alternatively, bake them in batches using the same baking sheet).</li>\n<li>In a ramekin, or a small bowl (preferably with tall sides), add a few tablespoons of granulated sugar, and set aside.</li>\n<li>In a big bowl, mix together the sugars, honey, oil, egg and vanilla with a rubber spatula. Ensure everything is well mixed before proceeding, the mix should emulsify (it will lighten in colour and look uniform). Break any big brown sugar lumps.</li>\n<li>Sift in the flour, salt and baking soda. Mix until just incorporated.</li>\n<li>With a small ice cream scoop or a table spoon, scoop some of the dough <em>(I use a <a href=\"https://www.chefs-resources.com/culinary-conversions-calculators-and-capacities/scoop-disher-sizes/\">#40 disher scoop</a>, which is roughly 1.5 tbsp)</em>. Scoop it out on the ramekin or bowl with sugar. Toss the dough ball in the ramekin to get it fully covered in sugar <em>(I like to move the ramekin in circular motion and have the ball hit the sides)</em>. Carefully lace the ball in the baking sheet.</li>\n<li>Repeat with all the remaining dough. Make sure to space them out because they will expand as they bake. If baking in multiple batches, rest the bowl in the fridge while a batch is baking and don't shape them until ready to place them in the sheet (otherwise they will flatten quickly).</li>\n<li>Bake for about 12 minutes or until golden brown and slightly cracked on top. They will be soft right out of the over and will harden as they cool.</li>\n</ol>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>First off… yes, I know this should be called a “flan” and not a “tart” (the difference is on the size, flan is big, tart is small), but I flat out refuse to call this a flan. To me, a flan is a custard and nothing will change my mind. So I’m calling this a tart while it technically isn’t. But who cares about technicalities.</p>\n<p>I’ve tried many different recipies for strawberry tart over the years. My go-to was a recipe for strawberry mini tarts that were cute but were only good right after making. The whipped cream always turned gooey after the first day.</p>\n<p>There is a bakery in Buenos Aires, a couple of blocks away from my in-law’s home that makes this beautiful and delicious strawberry tart that we used to get for every celebratory occasion. The crust is thick and crumbly, it has a generous layer of whipped cream inside and a lot of strawberries, glazed with a strawberry-flavoured jelly, and it’s topped with the most beautifully silky whipped cream swirls. It’s just perfect.</p>\n<p>Seb challenged me to replicate it. And I tried, working striclty from memory because it’s been over 2 years since the last time I had had it. It turned out pretty good!</p>\n<p>My biggest challenge was to figure out how to get the whipped cream hold its shape. Every time I made whipped cream, it became soupy after a while. I found out that the trick is to stabilize the cream. I used unflavoured gelatin and it worked wonderfully.</p>\n<p>I also had to figure out how to have the crust to come out nice and crumbly, just how I remembered it. After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that I had to go with a <em>pâte sablée</em> dough, so I ended up using my <a href=\"https://bakery.ar/lemon-meringue-pie/\">lemon meringue pie dough recipe</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients</h3>\n<h4 id=\"crust\">Crust</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>100g powdered sugar</li>\n<li>200g room-temperature butter</li>\n<li>300g all-purpose flour</li>\n<li>1 egg</li>\n<li>Pinch of salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"filling\">Filling</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>500g fresh strawberries</li>\n<li>1 red glaze envelope</li>\n<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>\n<li>3/4 cup boiling hot water</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"chantilly\">Chantilly</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>2 cups fresh whipping cream</li>\n<li>8 tbsp powdered sugar</li>\n<li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n<li>2 1/2 tbsp (1 envelope) unflavoured gelatin</li>\n<li>2 tbsp water</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"directions\">Directions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, beat the butter slowly until soft and creamy. Add the powdered sugar slowly, and then increase the speed.</li>\n<li>When the consistency becomes creamy and the colour lightens, add the egg and keep mixing.</li>\n<li>Add the flour and salt, and mix slowly until a firm dough forms. Do not overmix.</li>\n<li>Form a circle with the dough and cover with plastic wrap. Take to the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>\n<li>Once chilled, roll the dough in a floured surface.

Let it sit for a couple of minutes, until the granules stretch. Heat in the microwave for 5-10 seconds until the gelatin liquifies. Set aside.</li>\n<li>Start whipping the cream. Once thick, slowly incorporate the sugar. Once mixed, incorporate the vanilla extract. Once soft peaks form, incorporate the gelatin as the cream beats in a thin stream.

Mix well until desired thickness forms. Add the rest of the strawberry slices to the glaze and mix well.</li>\n<li>Cover the pie with the glazed strawberry slices, ensuring the entire pie is covered. Chill for at least one hour before decoratinh.</li>\n<li>Using the piping bag with a star tip, decorate the pie with the remaining chantilly.

They’re very similar to <em>croissants</em> in shape but the texture is slightly different. </p>\n<p>There are many types of medialunas: butter-style, lard-style, filled with dulce de leche, filled with ham and cheese. They’re a very versatile type of pastry so they pair well with pretty much everything.</p>\n<p>I also find the name <em>medialuna</em> magical. It means half-moon, and it obviously refers to its shape.</p>\n<p>I hadn’t had medialunas since I moved to Canada, and for some reason, there was a week where all Instagram showed me was recipes of medialunas. It was a sign (<em>that I share too much information with Facebook maybe</em>). I had never made them before so I ventured to try it. I knew they usually take a long time to make, so I obviously looked for the quickest recipe.</p>\n<p>This recipe makes a huge batch (I think around 30, depending on the size). I froze most of them, so they’re super convenient anytime, especially for breakfast. Seb loves them with ham and cheese (like a sandwich)! Just take them out of the freezer, warm them for 45 seconds on the microwave, fill them with whatever you want and bake for 5 minutes in a 300°F oven.

            "content_html": "<p>The first time I had Angel food cake was in the summer of 2019, after my husband Seb found a Betty Crocker Angel food cake box “very appealing” in the supermarket. It certainly looked very interesting: white and airy. I was super curious to find out what it tasted like. We had never heard of this type of cake back in Argentina.</p>\n<p>It was only when we got home that I learned that I needed a special tin for this cake. Luckily, I had a non-stick bundt cake pan, and after some Googling, I confirmed it could replace the original Angel food cake pan just fine.</p>\n<p>I made the cake following the box instructions (including trying to figure out how to rest the cake upside down… 🤔). Tasting time comes… I loved the cake. Seb… not so much. He didn’t appreciate the almond flavoring.</p>\n<p>A couple of months later, I decided to make this cake from scratch. I found a simple enough recipe on <a href=\"https://tasty.co/recipe/angel-food-cake-in-a-springform-pan\">Tasty</a> and it turned out beautifully. Needless to say, I don’t use almond extract in the homemade version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"ingredients\">Ingredients</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>\n<li>1 1/4 cups egg whites</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>\n<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>\n<li>pinch of salt</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"directions\">Directions</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Preheat oven to 350ºF.</li>\n<li>Sift the flour and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl. Reserve.</li>\n<li>Measure the egg whites (I buy pasteurized egg whites, refer to the original Tasty recipe if you have whole eggs – you’ll need to use cream of tartar).</li>\n<li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the egg whites, vanilla extract and salt. Beat in medium speed until soft peaks form.</li>\n<li>Increase the mixer speed and gradually incorporate the remaining 1 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time. Keep beaing until stiff peaks form.</li>\n<li>Carfully sift the flour and sugar mixture into the egg whites mixture. Do this incrementally, 1/4 cup at a time. Fold softly with a spatula until there are no clumps left. Be careful not to overmix.</li>\n<li>Transfer the batter into a non-greased non-stick bundt cake pan.</li>\n<li>Bake for 45 minutes, or until the cake has risen and the top is golden brown.</li>\n<li>While th cake bakes, prepare a wire rack and devise an “inverted cake holder”, as I like to call it. You need to invert the cake when it comes out of the oven, so find something you can use to keep it in place. I normally use the lid of my dutch oven, which has a flat handle (I rest the center of the inverted pan on the lid handle).</li>\n<li>Remove the cake from the oven and invert immediately. </li>\n<li>Let it cool for at least 45 minutes before removing the cake from the pan. To remove, run a spatula (or something soft as to not ruin the non-stick surface of the pan) along the outer edge of the pan.</li>\n<li>Serve with berries!</li>\n</ol>\n",
