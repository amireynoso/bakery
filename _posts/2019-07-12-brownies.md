Brownies are so easy to make, and they always turn out delicious. Everyone loves brownies, even people who don't love chocolate, like me! You can make them plain, or add walnuts for a crunchier result.

### Ingredients
* 125 g butter
* 150 g dark chocolate
* 2 eggs
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts

### Directions

1. Prepare a square or rectangular pan (makes cutting easier). Grease and line the pan with parchment paper.
1. Dice butter and chop chocolate (in case you're not using chips). Place both in a glass bowl.
1. Place the bowl over a saucepan with boiling water (water should not reach the top). This will act as a double boiler. Leave the bowl there until butter and chocolate melt, without mixing.
1. In another bowl, whisk the eggs with the sugar and the vanilla extract.
1. Once the chocolate and butter mixture has melted and cooled down, slowly incorporate the egg and sugar mixture into it while beating.
1. Sift the flour over the batter. Incorporate it slowly with a spatula. Do not overmix.
1. Add the chopped walnuts (or any other nut), and mix briefly.
1. Pour the batter in the pan and take to a pre-heated, 350Â°F oven. Bake for 20 minutes or until batter is set when pan you shake the pan.
