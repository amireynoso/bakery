Dulce de leche crepes are a staple of Argentinian cuisine. Everyone loves _dulce de leche_, and what best way to eat this delicious spread but with a soft, thin, unobtrusive cake-like layer?

Any restaurant you go in Buenos Aires will serve this dessert. Some may serve it fancier than others (e.g caramelized or with ice cream), but all are magnificently enjoyable.

This recipe is also extremely easy to make, and you end up with a delicious dessert in no time.

### Ingredients

* 5 tbsp of all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup milk
* 2 tbsp melted butter
* pinch of salt

### Directions
1. Mix the eggs with the flour and salt with a whisk until a smooth batter forms. I usually do this in a big measuring jar, for easier pouring later (and less cleaning!).
2. Incorporate the milk slowly, mixing. The consistency should be fluid, but not watery. Ensure there are no clumps.
3. Heat a small non-stick pan over medium heat.
4. Melt the butter in the pan. Incorporate to the mixture once melted. The butter coating in the pan should be enough for the entire batch.
5. Pour a small quantity of the mixture in the pan (I usually pour around 1/4 cup, but it depends on the size of the pan). Move the pan in circular motions so the mixture covers the entire surface. It should be a thin layer.
6. Cook until the borders start to come off the edges, about 1-2 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, carefully flip the crepe.
7. Cook the other side for about 1 more minute, and remove from pan. Continue with the rest of the batter.
8. To serve, spread a good amount of dulce de leche on the crepe, and then roll it. Serve immediately.
