Earlier this year, I had ordered a veggie box that came with a lot of carrots. I made soup and roasted carrots for dinner, and I still had a bunch left over. So I decided to experiment with a carrot cake loaf!

I love making loafs, they’re so simple and versatile and they last me many breakfasts. They’re also very convenient to freeze since once it’s sliced, it doesn’t take up a lot of space. I always have a loaf in the freezer because it’s easy peasy to take out some slices, pop them in the microwave for a minute and have a breakfast (or a _merienda_) ready in no time!

I based this loaf in a recipe that I found on an healthy food Instagram account (I can’t remember which one), and as I was baking it, I adapted it to what I had in my pantry. It turned out great and my co-workers loved it!

I made it so late one weeknight that I completely forgot to take a picture of it, oopsies.

### Ingredients

* 2 carrots
* 1 banana
* 3 eggs
* 1/4 cup skim milk
* 1/2 cup brown sugar, plus extra to sprinkle

* 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
* 1/2 cup all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda

### Directions


#### Before you start, make sure to...

1. Line a loaf tin with parchment paper.

#### Prepare your ingredients

1. Chop the walnuts to desired size (you can do this with a food processor).
2. Peel and shred the carrots.
3. Mash the banana with a fork.
4. Process the steel cut oats in a food processor until it’s similar to flour (not too fine).
5. Mix the dry ingredients (flours, spices, salt, baking powder and soda) and reserve.

#### Ready, get set, bake!

1. Whisk the eggs in a bowl for a couple of minutes.
2. Mix in the banana, sugar, milk, and vanilla extract and keep whisking.
3. Slowly integrate the dry ingredients while still whisking.
4. At last, integrate the carrots and walnuts with a spatula.
5. Pour batter into the tin.
6. Sprinkle the top with a little of brown sugar to get a crispy crust.
7. Bake for 35 minutes or until sticking a knife to the middle of the loaf comes out dry.
