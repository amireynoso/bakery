In case it wasn't clear before: dulce de leche is my favourite food. And one of the things I miss most from Argentina is good quality ice cream. In Buenos Aires, you can order ice cream to be delivered to your door pretty much 24/7, all year round. You order it by the kilogram. We love our ice cream. And the best flavour in my opinion is -- you guessed it -- dulce de leche.

You can find any ice cream flavour that you can imagine. Anything with dulce de leche in it will be in my order. I go back and forth, but one of my all-time favourites is _super dulce de leche granizado_, which basically is a dulce de leche cream, with chocolate chips and natural dulce de leche swirls.

Making ice cream at home is not an easy feat. You typically need the fancy ice cream machines to get decent ice cream. I came across [this recipe by Paulina Cocina](https://www.paulinacocina.net/helado-de-dulce-de-leche-casero/8679){:target="_blank"} (she's a great home cook) and it seemed too simple to be true. I set out to try it and the results are really good. It's nothing like you'd find in a Buenos Aires _helader√≠a_, but it's pretty decent. The only reason why I don't make this every weekend is that it takes over a day to get it done. I usually need to start making it very early on a Saturday to enjoy it on Sunday. But it's worth it!

### Ingredients
* 500 g dulce de leche
* 250 ml heavy cream
* 250 ml milk
* chocolate chips (optional)
* more dulce de leche for the swirls (optional)

### Directions
1. In a standing mixer, beat the dulce de leche with the heavy cream until smooth.
1. Add milk and beat a little longer, until well combined.
1. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 2 to 3 hours.
1. After 2-3 hours, remove bowl from freezer and beat again for a bit, until it creamy. Take back to the freezer.
1. Repeat this process a few times, until the consistency is ice-cream-like.
1. Before putting in the freezer for the last time, add chocolate chips and spoonfuls of dulce de leche. Mix carefully with a spatula to integrate.
1. Serve with an ice cream scoop. I like serving it with strawberries, more dulce de leche and wafers.
