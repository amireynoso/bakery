Back in Argentina, we don't really make pancakes or hot cakes as they're commonly known in North America. Instead, we make crepes (which we call "panqueques", as in _pancakes_) with lots and lots of dulce de leche.

My mom sent me this recipe to try not long ago and I was hooked because it's so easy to make and they're super delicious. They do not rise as much as regular pancakes, but they're still amazing.

### Ingredients

* 1 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 cup milk
* 1 egg
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* pinch of salt
* butter

### Directions

1. Mix all ingredients together until you get a thick and homogenous batter (I usually do this in a big measuring cup).
2. Chill in fridge for at least 30 minutes.
3. Brush a pancake pan pre-heated in medium heat with butter.
4. Pour about 1/4 cup batter from measuring cup in the pan, forming a circle of about 6cm in diameter. Do not move the pan!
5. Flip when bubbles form in the surface, about after a minute and a half.
6. Leave for one more minute so the other side cooks.
7. Serve hot! I like serving them with dulce de leche.
