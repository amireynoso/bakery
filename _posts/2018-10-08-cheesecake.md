What's not to love about cheesecake? It's delicious and it's also relatively simple to make. Win-win! I love making this cheesecake for birthdays (especially my own), and it's always super successful.

I made my first cheesecake in Canada using the Philadelphia cream cheese [original cheesecake recipe](https://www.kraftwhatscooking.ca/recipe/classic-philadelphia-cheesecake-recipe-philadelphia-brick-cream-cheese-82700) and I have since adapted (and let me say, _perfectioned_) it.

I used to make it from scratch with Graham cracker crumbs (like the big one on the picture), and I still do sometimes. But I found that using the ready-made Graham pie crust works better and it's quicker. ðŸ’«

### Ingredients
* 2 pkg. (250 g each) Philadelphia Brick Cream Cheese, softened
* 2/3 cup sugar (1/2 cup for filling, the rest for the jam)
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla

* 1 ready-to-use graham cracker crumb crust (9-inch)
* 1 pint raspberries

### Directions
1. Pre-heat oven to 325Â°F.
1. Beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla in the bowl of a standing mixer until blended.
1. Add the eggs and beat just until blended.
1. Pour into crust. Bake for 40 minutes or until centre is almost set.
1. Remove from the oven and let it cool. Refrigerate 3 hours.
1. To make the jam, mix 2/3 of the raspberries with the sugar in a medium-sized saucepan.
1. Bring the saucepan into the stovetop and cook in low heat for 15 minutes or until jam has no lumps.
1. Remove from the heat and let it cool.
1. Pour on top of the chilled cheesecake. Decorate with the remaining raspberries.
