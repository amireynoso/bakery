I must confess, I'm not a big chocolate fan. But there is something about good, chewy, warm chocolate chip cookies that I can't resist.

I wasn't big on chocolate chip cookies before I moved to Canada. I think the first time I made them at home was using the pre-made Pillsbury chocolate chip cookies dough. Seb and I got instantly hooked. Then I came across [this Tasty recipe](https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies) and there was no going back. Since then I make them from scratch everytime.

### Ingredients
* ½ cup granulated sugar
* ¾ cup brown sugar
* 1 teaspoon salt
* ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
* 1 egg
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour
* ½ teaspoon baking soda
* 200 grams semi-sweet chocolate chips (or chunks if you prefer)

### Directions

1. In the bowl of a standing mixer, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until the mixture lightens its color and soft ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (do not overmix).
4. Fold in the chocolate chips, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. The longer you chill the dough, the richer the taste.
5. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving space between cookies so that the cookies can spread evenly. I usually bake 6 cookies at a time.
7. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.
8. Cool in a wire rack before serving. Or if you're anything like me, eat them almost as soon as they're out of the oven for the best gooey experience.
