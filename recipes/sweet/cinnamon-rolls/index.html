  <p>I’d had this very intense cinnamon roll craving for a while until I decided to act on it while watching Hamilton one summer weekend. It was quite late in the afternoon and from what I knew, cinnamon rolls take a couple of hours to make. Because I was lazy <em>and</em> hungry, I searched for the quickest cinnamon roll recipe.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/cinnamon-rolls-2.jpg" alt="Close-up of a cinnamon roll" width="600" height="600" /></p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://therecipecritic.com/quick-45-minute-cinnamon-rolls/" target="_blank">this beautiful recipe</a> by The Recipe Critic, and it turned out to be amazing! I only modified it slightly to make it more to my tasting.</p>

<p>I made a big batch and had to freeze the rest in order to force myself not to eat them all in one sitting. They were that good.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<h4 id="dough">Dough</h4>
<ul>
  <li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
  <li>1 tsp salt</li>
  <li>2 1/4 tsp instant yeast (1 package)</li>
  <li>1/2 cup water</li>
  <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
  <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
  <li>1 large egg</li>
  <li>zest of 1 orange or lemon</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="filling">Filling</h4>
<ul>
  <li>60 g unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
  <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
  <li>1/2 tbsp cinnamon</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="glaze">Glaze</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
  <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
  <li>2-3 tbps milk</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, mix the flour, sugar, salt, zest and yeast. Set aside.</li>
  <li>In a bowl apt for microwaving (I use a measuing jar), heat the water, milk and butter for 30-45 seconds in the microwave, 1ntil the butter is melted.</li>
  <li>Pour the liquid mixture into the bowl of the standing mixer.</li>
  <li>Add the egg (I always crack the egg in a ramekin first).</li>
  <li>Knead in medium speed for 3-4 minutes until the dough is no longer sticky.</li>
  <li>Set the bowl aside and cover it with a damp towel. Let rest for at least 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 200ºF.</li>
  <li>Mix the softened butter with the sugar and the cinnamon.</li>
  <li>After the dough has rested, roll it out to a big rectangle.</li>
  <li>Spread the butter mixture evenly on top.</li>
  <li>Roll up the dough tightly. Cut into 8-9 even pieces.</li>
  <li>Turn off the oven.</li>
  <li>Place the rolls in a lightly greased pan (I used a pie plate). Cover with plastic wrap.</li>
  <li>Place the pan in the turned off oven for about 20 minutes, so rolls can rise.</li>
  <li>After 20 minutes, or when rolls have doubled in size, remove pan from the oven and remove the plastic wrap.</li>
  <li>Turn on the oven to 375ºF. Wait until oven has reached this temperature before putting the pan back in the oven.</li>
  <li>Bake cinnamon rolls for 15-20 minutes, until golden.</li>
  <li>While rolls bake, make the glaze by mixing the powdered sugar, vanilla extract and milk until smooth.</li>
  <li>Remove the pan from the oven and top rolls with glaze. Cool before serving.</li>
</ol>
