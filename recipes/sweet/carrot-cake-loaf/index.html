  <p>Earlier this year, I had ordered a veggie box that came with a lot of carrots. I made soup and roasted carrots for dinner, and I still had a bunch left over. So I decided to experiment with a carrot cake loaf!</p>

<p>I love making loafs, they’re so simple and versatile and they last me many breakfasts. They’re also very convenient to freeze since once it’s sliced, it doesn’t take up a lot of space. I always have a loaf in the freezer because it’s easy peasy to take out some slices, pop them in the microwave for a minute and have a breakfast (or a <em>merienda</em>) ready in no time!</p>

<p>I based this loaf in a recipe that I found on an healthy food Instagram account (I can’t remember which one), and as I was baking it, I adapted it to what I had in my pantry. It turned out great and my co-workers loved it!</p>

<p>I made it so late one weeknight that I completely forgot to take a picture of it, oopsies.</p>
