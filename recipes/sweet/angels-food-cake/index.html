  <p>The first time I had Angel food cake was in the summer of 2019, after my husband Seb found a Betty Crocker Angel food cake box “very appealing” in the supermarket. It certainly looked very interesting: white and airy. I was super curious to find out what it tasted like. We had never heard of this type of cake back in Argentina.</p>

<p>It was only when we got home that I learned that I needed a special tin for this cake. Luckily, I had a non-stick bundt cake pan, and after some Googling, I confirmed it could replace the original Angel food cake pan just fine.</p>

<p>I made the cake following the box instructions (including trying to figure out how to rest the cake upside down… 🤔). Tasting time comes… I loved the cake. Seb… not so much. He didn’t appreciate the almond flavoring.</p>

<p>A couple of months later, I decided to make this cake from scratch. I found a simple enough recipe on <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/angel-food-cake-in-a-springform-pan" target="_blank">Tasty</a> and it turned out beautifully. Needless to say, I don’t use almond extract in the homemade version.</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
  <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 1/4 cups egg whites</li>
  <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
  <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF.</li>
  <li>Sift the flour and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl. Reserve.</li>
  <li>Measure the egg whites (I buy pasteurized egg whites, refer to the original Tasty recipe if you have whole eggs – you’ll need to use cream of tartar).</li>
  <li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the egg whites, vanilla extract and salt. Beat in medium speed until soft peaks form.</li>
  <li>Increase the mixer speed and gradually incorporate the remaining 1 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time. Keep beaing until stiff peaks form.</li>
  <li>Carfully sift the flour and sugar mixture into the egg whites mixture. Do this incrementally, 1/4 cup at a time. Fold softly with a spatula until there are no clumps left. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
  <li>Transfer the batter into a non-greased non-stick bundt cake pan.</li>
  <li>Bake for 45 minutes, or until the cake has risen and the top is golden brown.</li>
  <li>While th cake bakes, prepare a wire rack and devise an “inverted cake holder”, as I like to call it. You need to invert the cake when it comes out of the oven, so find something you can use to keep it in place. I normally use the lid of my dutch oven, which has a flat handle (I rest the center of the inverted pan on the lid handle).</li>
  <li>Remove the cake from the oven and invert immediately.</li>
  <li>Let it cool for at least 45 minutes before removing the cake from the pan. To remove, run a spatula (or something soft as to not ruin the non-stick surface of the pan) along the outer edge of the pan.</li>
  <li>Serve with berries!</li>
</ol>
