                <p>Melitas are very popular honey cookies from Argentina. I couldn't find anything similar in Canada, so I started making them myself. I started off with <a href="https://matiaschavero.com/2020/12/03/galletas-de-miel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matias Chavero's recipe</a> and after many batches and many small tweaks, I found the perfect balance to make them to my tasting. They are, dare I say, even better than the original cookies. I love dunking them on tea!</p>
<p>This recipe yields about 20 cookies, and they can be frozen either before or after baking. They keep really well for about a week in an airtight container.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>135 g <em>(⅔ cup + 1 tbsp)</em> neutral flavour vegetable oil (I use sunflower seed oil)</li>
<li>175 g <em>(1 cup, packed)</em> brown sugar (either dark, light or a combination of both works)</li>
<li>10 g (2 tsp) granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>70 g <em>(¼ cup)</em> honey</li>
<li>230 g <em>(1 ⅓ cup)</em> all-purpose flour</li>
<li>5 g <em>(1 tsp)</em> baking soda</li>
<li>2 g <em>(½ tsp)</em> salt</li>
<li>5 g <em>(1 tsp)</em> vanilla extract</li>
<li>About ¼ cup granulated sugar to decorate</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 360ºF</li>
<li>Line a couple baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats (alternatively, bake them in batches using the same baking sheet).</li>
<li>In a ramekin, or a small bowl (preferably with tall sides), add a few tablespoons of granulated sugar, and set aside.</li>
<li>In a big bowl, mix together the sugars, honey, oil, egg and vanilla with a rubber spatula. Ensure everything is well mixed before proceeding, the mix should emulsify (it will lighten in colour and look uniform). Break any big brown sugar lumps.</li>
<li>Sift in the flour, salt and baking soda. Mix until just incorporated.</li>
<li>With a small ice cream scoop or a table spoon, scoop some of the dough <em>(I use a <a href="https://www.chefs-resources.com/culinary-conversions-calculators-and-capacities/scoop-disher-sizes/">#40 disher scoop</a>, which is roughly 1.5 tbsp)</em>. Scoop it out on the ramekin or bowl with sugar. Toss the dough ball in the ramekin to get it fully covered in sugar <em>(I like to move the ramekin in circular motion and have the ball hit the sides)</em>. Carefully lace the ball in the baking sheet.</li>
<li>Repeat with all the remaining dough. Make sure to space them out because they will expand as they bake. If baking in multiple batches, rest the bowl in the fridge while a batch is baking and don't shape them until ready to place them in the sheet (otherwise they will flatten quickly).</li>
<li>Bake for about 12 minutes or until golden brown and slightly cracked on top. They will be soft right out of the over and will harden as they cool.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Cake</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">315g all-purpose flour</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">300g granulated sugar</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">227g buttermilk</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">170g unsalted butter, softened</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 large eggs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15g white vinegar</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">15g natural cocoa powder</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30g liquid red food colouring</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">8g baking soda</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">5g vanilla extract</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pinch of salt</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Frosting</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">170g butter, at room temperature</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">340g cream cheese, at room temperature</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">450g icing sugar</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2 tsp vanilla extract</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Preparation</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Cake</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350ºF. Line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper, or grease and flour them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sift or whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a bowl. Set aside.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In another bowl whisk together the buttermilk with the vinegar eggs and vanilla extract. Set aside.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a standing mixer or using a hand mixer, beat the butter and sugar until fluffy, about 2 minutes or longer. Scrape down the bowl as necessary.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add ⅓ of the flour mixture and mix on medium-low speed until just incorporated.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add ½ of the buttermilk mixture and beat on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrape down the bowl as necessary and repeat with ½ of the remaining flour mixture, the remaining buttermilk mixture, and finally the remaining flour mixture.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrape down the bowl, add the cocoa powder and the food colouring. Beat on medium speed until completely incorporated, about 30 seconds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using a rubber spatula, give the batter a final stir. Scrape into prepared pans. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cool the cakes in the pans for 10 minutes then turn out onto a rack to cool completely, at least 30 minutes.</span></li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Notes</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If only one pan is available, either:</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bake it all at once (ensure the pan is deep enough to contain all the batter and not be over  ⅔ full), or</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bake it in two batches, dividing the mixture in half and reserving the remaining batter in the fridge while the first pan is in the oven. Ensure to reline or grease the cooled pan before baking the second one.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Frosting</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beat the cream cheese and butter on high until creamy</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add vanilla. Then, add the sugar in batches. Scrape down the sides of the bowl in between each addition. Beat on medium-high until light and fluffy.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Assembly</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the layers have a dome on top, cut it out with a long serrated knife (bread knife) or a cake leveler. If starting from a single layer cake, divide it into two layers of approximately the same height. Keep the crumbs to decorate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reserve the flattest layer (usually the bottom) for the top.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place the bottom layer on a cake plate and add a generous amount of frosting. Spread it over the layer with an offset spatula.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stack the top layer on top.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Add more frosting on top and with an offset or straight spatula, spread it from the center to the edges.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mask the sides of the cake with the remaining frosting.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decorate the sides and/or top with crumbs.</span></li>
</ol>

                <p>I had never had madeleines before trying this recipe (which I had to make for my Cookies class), and I must say they were a huge hit. Turns out the hump they get when baking is a good thing, even though it looks like something went wrong.</p>

</figure>
<p>There's a few gotchas with these cake-like cookies, though:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need a special pan</li>
<li>The batter needs to rest overnight, so you need to make them the day before baking</li>
<li>They have a very short shelf life</li>
</ol>
<p>They're worth it!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>150g butter</li>
<li>140g sugar</li>
<li>25g honey</li>
<li>4g salt</li>
<li>3 large eggs</li>
<li>zest of 1 lemon</li>
<li>150g pastry flour</li>
<li>4g baking powder</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Melt the butter</li>
<li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, add the sugar, eggs, honey, lemon and salt</li>
<li>Mix on high speed with the whisk attachment until almost ribbon stage (about 5 minutes)</li>
<li>Sift the pastry flour and the baking powder on the bowl and gently fold them in with a spatula or bowl scraper</li>
<li>Add the melted butter and fold in gently</li>
<li>Cover and chill the batter overnight on the fridge</li>
<li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350ºF</li>
<li>Fill the moulds about 3/4 full (for my size of pan, I used a number 40 ice cream scoop)</li>
<li>Bake for about 6 to 7 minutes or until golden</li>

                    <p><img src="https://bakery.ar/media/posts/16/strawberry-cream-tart.jpeg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>First off… yes, I know this should be called a “flan” and not a “tart” (the difference is on the size, flan is big, tart is small), but I flat out refuse to call this a flan. To me, a flan is a custard and nothing will change my mind. So I’m calling this a tart while it technically isn’t. But who cares about technicalities.</p>
<p>I’ve tried many different recipies for strawberry tart over the years. My go-to was a recipe for strawberry mini tarts that were cute but were only good right after making. The whipped cream always turned gooey after the first day.</p>
<p>There is a bakery in Buenos Aires, a couple of blocks away from my in-law’s home that makes this beautiful and delicious strawberry tart that we used to get for every celebratory occasion. The crust is thick and crumbly, it has a generous layer of whipped cream inside and a lot of strawberries, glazed with a strawberry-flavoured jelly, and it’s topped with the most beautifully silky whipped cream swirls. It’s just perfect.</p>
<p>Seb challenged me to replicate it. And I tried, working striclty from memory because it’s been over 2 years since the last time I had had it. It turned out pretty good!</p>
<p>My biggest challenge was to figure out how to get the whipped cream hold its shape. Every time I made whipped cream, it became soupy after a while. I found out that the trick is to stabilize the cream. I used unflavoured gelatin and it worked wonderfully.</p>
<p>I also had to figure out how to have the crust to come out nice and crumbly, just how I remembered it. After doing some research, I came to the conclusion that I had to go with a <em>pâte sablée</em> dough, so I ended up using my <a href="https://bakery.ar/lemon-meringue-pie/">lemon meringue pie dough recipe</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<h4 id="crust">Crust</h4>
<ul>
<li>100g powdered sugar</li>
<li>200g room-temperature butter</li>
<li>300g all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filling">Filling</h4>
<ul>
<li>500g fresh strawberries</li>
<li>1 red glaze envelope</li>
<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
<li>3/4 cup boiling hot water</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="chantilly">Chantilly</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 cups fresh whipping cream</li>
<li>8 tbsp powdered sugar</li>
<li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>2 1/2 tbsp (1 envelope) unflavoured gelatin</li>
<li>2 tbsp water</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, beat the butter slowly until soft and creamy. Add the powdered sugar slowly, and then increase the speed.</li>
<li>When the consistency becomes creamy and the colour lightens, add the egg and keep mixing.</li>
<li>Add the flour and salt, and mix slowly until a firm dough forms. Do not overmix.</li>
<li>Form a circle with the dough and cover with plastic wrap. Take to the fridge to rest for at least 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Once chilled, roll the dough in a floured surface. Cover the pie dish and press against the side. Try to use all the dough, this layer needs to be thich. Tap base with a fork.</li>
<li>Cover the dish and dough with aluminium foil and press. Add baking weights.</li>
<li>Take to a pre-heated 350°F oven for about 15 minutes. After that time, remove the weights and foil, and cook for 5 more minutes. Let cool after taking out of the oven.</li>
<li>While the dough bakes, chill the standing mixer’s bowl (use a metal one if possible), alongside the mixer’s whip attachment, for at least 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Prepare the gelatin by mixing the powder with the water in a microwave-safe bowl. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, until the granules stretch. Heat in the microwave for 5-10 seconds until the gelatin liquifies. Set aside.</li>
<li>Start whipping the cream. Once thick, slowly incorporate the sugar. Once mixed, incorporate the vanilla extract. Once soft peaks form, incorporate the gelatin as the cream beats in a thin stream. Continue beating, keeking an eye on it, until stiff peaks form.</li>
<li>Transfer chantilly to a decorating bag. Use about 2/3 of the chantilly to fill the crust. Chill the rest of the cream.</li>
<li>Wash and remove stems from the strawberries. Cut them in slices. Lay the around 2/3 of the slices over the cream layer.</li>
<li>Mix the red glaze with the sugar in a big bowl and incorporate the boiling water, 1/4 cup at a time. Mix well until desired thickness forms. Add the rest of the strawberry slices to the glaze and mix well.</li>
<li>Cover the pie with the glazed strawberry slices, ensuring the entire pie is covered. Chill for at least one hour before decoratinh.</li>
<li>Using the piping bag with a star tip, decorate the pie with the remaining chantilly. Chill for at least 1 more hour before serving.</li>

                <p>I’d had this very intense cinnamon roll craving for a while until I decided to act on it while watching Hamilton one summer weekend. It was quite late in the afternoon and from what I knew, cinnamon rolls take a couple of hours to make. Because I was lazy <em>and</em> hungry, I searched for the quickest cinnamon roll recipe.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="https://therecipecritic.com/quick-45-minute-cinnamon-rolls/">this beautiful recipe</a> by The Recipe Critic, and it turned out to be amazing! I only modified it slightly to make it more to my tasting.</p>
<p>I made a big batch and had to freeze the rest in order to force myself not to eat them all in one sitting. They were that good.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<h4 id="dough">Dough</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>2 1/4 tsp instant yeast (1 package)</li>
<li>1/2 cup water</li>
<li>1/4 cup milk</li>
<li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>zest of 1 orange or lemon</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filling">Filling</h4>
<ul>
<li>60 g unsalted butter at room temperature</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>1/2 tbsp cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="glaze">Glaze</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>2-3 tbps milk</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, mix the flour, sugar, salt, zest and yeast. Set aside.</li>
<li>In a bowl apt for microwaving (I use a measuing jar), heat the water, milk and butter for 30-45 seconds in the microwave, 1ntil the butter is melted.</li>
<li>Pour the liquid mixture into the bowl of the standing mixer.</li>
<li>Add the egg (I always crack the egg in a ramekin first).</li>
<li>Knead in medium speed for 3-4 minutes until the dough is no longer sticky.</li>
<li>Set the bowl aside and cover it with a damp towel. Let rest for at least 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 200ºF.</li>
<li>Mix the softened butter with the sugar and the cinnamon.</li>
<li>After the dough has rested, roll it out to a big rectangle.</li>
<li>Spread the butter mixture evenly on top.</li>
<li>Roll up the dough tightly. Cut into 8-9 even pieces.</li>
<li>Turn off the oven.</li>
<li>Place the rolls in a lightly greased pan (I used a pie plate). Cover with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Place the pan in the turned off oven for about 20 minutes, so rolls can rise.</li>
<li>After 20 minutes, or when rolls have doubled in size, remove pan from the oven and remove the plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Turn on the oven to 375ºF. Wait until oven has reached this temperature before putting the pan back in the oven.</li>
<li>Bake cinnamon rolls for 15-20 minutes, until golden.</li>
<li>While rolls bake, make the glaze by mixing the powdered sugar, vanilla extract and milk until smooth.</li>
<li>Remove the pan from the oven and top rolls with glaze. Cool before serving.</li>

                <p>If you go to any bakery in Argentina (in Buenos Aires you’ll see one every two blocks), you’ll find lots of <em>medialunas</em>. They’re very similar to <em>croissants</em> in shape but the texture is slightly different. </p>
<p>There are many types of medialunas: butter-style, lard-style, filled with dulce de leche, filled with ham and cheese. They’re a very versatile type of pastry so they pair well with pretty much everything.</p>
<p>I also find the name <em>medialuna</em> magical. It means half-moon, and it obviously refers to its shape.</p>
<p>I hadn’t had medialunas since I moved to Canada, and for some reason, there was a week where all Instagram showed me was recipes of medialunas. It was a sign (<em>that I share too much information with Facebook maybe</em>). I had never made them before so I ventured to try it. I knew they usually take a long time to make, so I obviously looked for the quickest recipe.</p>
<p>This recipe makes a huge batch (I think around 30, depending on the size). I froze most of them, so they’re super convenient anytime, especially for breakfast. Seb loves them with ham and cheese (like a sandwich)! Just take them out of the freezer, warm them for 45 seconds on the microwave, fill them with whatever you want and bake for 5 minutes in a 300°F oven. Voilà!</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<h4 id="dough">Dough</h4>
<ul>
<li>10g active dry yeast</li>
<li>480g all-purpose flour</li>
<li>50g room-temperature butter</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>40g sugar</li>
<li>250ml milk</li>
<li>125ml water</li>
<li>Pinch of salt</li>
<li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="syrup">Syrup</h4>
<ul>
<li>100g sugar</li>
<li>100ml water</li>
<li>2 slices of any citrus fruit (i.e. lemon, orange, lime)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, using a knead hook, mix the yeast with the flour well.</li>
<li>Add the butter and mix with until incorporated.</li>
<li>Add the egg and the sugar and keep kneading.</li>
<li>Slowly add the water until the dough forms. Knead for a couple of minutes. The dough should be sticky so don’t add more flour.</li>
<li>Cover the dough with a damp towel and place in a warm surface (the stovetop should do fine).</li>
<li>Once the dough has doubled in size, transfer to a floured surface. Roll into a rectangular shape until the dough is about 1 cm thick.</li>
<li>Cut the dough in triangles. Shape the triangles into a crescent shape. To do this, put the triangle facing you upside down. Then roll it with your hands towards you.</li>
<li>Place the medialunas in a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Have each medialuna rest on the tips of the previous one (see pictures for reference), but leave some space between each other because they still need to rise one more time.</li>
<li>Let them rest in shape for about 10 more minutes or until risen. Paint them with an egg wash.</li>
<li>Bake in a pre-heated oven at 350°F for 15 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
<li>While they bake, make the syrup. In a small saucepan add the water, sugar and citrus slices. Don’t mix it and let it bring to a boil. When big bubbles form, turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Once the medialunas are out of the oven, brush the top with the syrup.</li>

                <p>The first time I had Angel food cake was in the summer of 2019, after my husband Seb found a Betty Crocker Angel food cake box “very appealing” in the supermarket. It certainly looked very interesting: white and airy. I was super curious to find out what it tasted like. We had never heard of this type of cake back in Argentina.</p>
<p>It was only when we got home that I learned that I needed a special tin for this cake. Luckily, I had a non-stick bundt cake pan, and after some Googling, I confirmed it could replace the original Angel food cake pan just fine.</p>
<p>I made the cake following the box instructions (including trying to figure out how to rest the cake upside down… 🤔). Tasting time comes… I loved the cake. Seb… not so much. He didn’t appreciate the almond flavoring.</p>
<p>A couple of months later, I decided to make this cake from scratch. I found a simple enough recipe on <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/angel-food-cake-in-a-springform-pan">Tasty</a> and it turned out beautifully. Needless to say, I don’t use almond extract in the homemade version.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 1/4 cups egg whites</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="directions">Directions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350ºF.</li>
<li>Sift the flour and 1/2 cup of the sugar in a medium bowl. Reserve.</li>
<li>Measure the egg whites (I buy pasteurized egg whites, refer to the original Tasty recipe if you have whole eggs – you’ll need to use cream of tartar).</li>
<li>In the bowl of a standing mixer, combine the egg whites, vanilla extract and salt. Beat in medium speed until soft peaks form.</li>
<li>Increase the mixer speed and gradually incorporate the remaining 1 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons at a time. Keep beaing until stiff peaks form.</li>
<li>Carfully sift the flour and sugar mixture into the egg whites mixture. Do this incrementally, 1/4 cup at a time. Fold softly with a spatula until there are no clumps left. Be careful not to overmix.</li>
<li>Transfer the batter into a non-greased non-stick bundt cake pan.</li>
<li>Bake for 45 minutes, or until the cake has risen and the top is golden brown.</li>
<li>While th cake bakes, prepare a wire rack and devise an “inverted cake holder”, as I like to call it. You need to invert the cake when it comes out of the oven, so find something you can use to keep it in place. I normally use the lid of my dutch oven, which has a flat handle (I rest the center of the inverted pan on the lid handle).</li>
<li>Remove the cake from the oven and invert immediately. </li>
<li>Let it cool for at least 45 minutes before removing the cake from the pan. To remove, run a spatula (or something soft as to not ruin the non-stick surface of the pan) along the outer edge of the pan.</li>
<li>Serve with berries!</li>
