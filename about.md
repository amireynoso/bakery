### 🙋🏽‍♀️ The baker

My name is Ami Reynoso and I'm an amateur baker and professional web developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina, currently living in Toronto, Canada.

I've been baking since I was a kid and my ultimate dream is to have a huge kitchen with lots of counter space.

I love baking for family and friends and trying new recipes and techniques. Not all attempts are successful, but at least I have fun and get eat the treats afterwards.

Also, you should know my favourite food in the whole universe is Dulce de Leche.

### 📝 The recipes

For the longest time, I've kept my tried and trusted recipes in my Google Keep account, but they became hard to find, manage and share. So, I decided to publish them for everyone to see! This blog is mostly for me, though.

Funny story, my Twitter handle is [@bakery](https://twitter.com/bakery) (for completely different reasons) and my friends insisted I use it to advertise my baking adventures.

I don't think I have many original recipes, they all have been adapted from somewhere else. Since I've collected and tried recipes for years, it's likely that I no longer have the original source (sorry! 🙏). I'm not claiming anything you find in here is my brainchild, this is just a collection of my favourite recipes.
