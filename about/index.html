        <h2>About Bakery</h2>

<h3 id="️-the-baker">🙋🏽‍♀️ The baker</h3>

<p>My name is Ami Reynoso and I’m an amateur baker and professional web developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina, currently living in Toronto, Canada.</p>

<p>I’ve been baking since I was a kid and my ultimate dream is to have a huge kitchen with lots of counter space.</p>

<p>I love baking for family and friends and trying new recipes and techniques. Not all attempts are successful, but at least I have fun and get to eat the treats afterwards.</p>

<p>Also, you should know my favourite food in the whole universe is Dulce de Leche.</p>

<h3 id="-the-recipes">📝 The recipes</h3>

<p>For the longest time, I’ve kept my tried and trusted recipes in Google Keep, but they became hard to find, manage and share. So, I decided to publish them for everyone to see! This “blog” is mostly for me, though.</p>

<p>Funny story, my Twitter handle is <a href="https://twitter.com/bakery" target="_blank">@bakery</a> (for completely different reasons) and my friends insisted I use it to advertise my baking adventures.</p>

<p>I don’t think I have many original recipes, they all have been adapted from somewhere else. Since I’ve collected and tried recipes for years, it’s likely that I no longer have the original source (sorry! 🙏). I’m not claiming anything you find in here is my brainchild, this is just a collection of my favourite recipes.</p>
